<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
Hi! I'm Sasank Potluri, a robotics engineer pursuing MS in Robotics at Northeastern University. I am broadly interested in robust sensor fusion for safe autonomy, I currently work under Hanumanth Singh a Northeastern University Field Robotics Lab where my focus is on improving visual SLAM systems for autonomous robots. My work mainly focuses on visual-inertial navigation systems for high-speed autonomous navigation. My current projects include IMU Preintegration for Real-Time Visual-Inertial Odometry

<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
I graduated with B.tech in Mechanical Engineering from Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal. Prior to Northeastern I worked as a Research Assistant in Manipal University  on Water-lubricated Hydrodynamic bearings under Professor <a href="https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/navaneeth-krishna-vernekar/_jcr_content.html">Navneeth Krishna Verneker</a>

<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
During My Bachelor's I was part of a student project called <a href="https://www.formulamanipal.in/">Formula Manipal</a> that built small formula style race cars. I mainly worked on the structural design and manufacturing of Automobile Parts

I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of visual perception to enable reliable autonomy in the real world. You can view some of my work on <a href="https://github.com/sasank98">GitHub</a>. Please feel free to reach out to me. I will complete my MS in Robotics in April 2024 and continue pursuing my dream of developing autonomous systems that can operate safely and effectively in complex, unlabeled environments.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Outside of my core research, I enjoy working on computer vision projects related to 3D scene view synthesis, image super-resolution and Diffusion Models. These include , stereo depth mapping, and more.
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator** -->

<!-- I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
